  <h2>Originally I was passionate about computer science, but now I wish I was never passionate about it. The simplest missing semicolon can mess up your entire code and after hours of coding, you wouldn't even be able to find said missing semicolon because of the mountain of code. Aside from my hatred for computer science, I enjoy hands-on work that doesn't require much thinking and I also like to go hiking from time to time. The quietness of hiking is the best feeling because you are left with nothing but nature around you, the sound of water crashing against rocks, the sound of birds chirping, and the crickets chriping at night to one another. Stargazing is also a pretty fun thing that I enjoy due to the beautiful stars of all shapes and sizes with different kinds of shine, some standing out and some shining brighter than others.</h2>
